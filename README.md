# Python Classes: Medical Insurance Project
I have developed a system that makes it easier to organize patient data. 
I have created a class that does the following:
- Takes in patient parameters regarding their personal information
- Contains methods that allow users to update their information
- Gives patients insight into their potential medical fees.
